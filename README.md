Author: Ian P (ipavl)

JChat is a simple client-server chat program written in Java with support for basic IRC-style commands, user registration, and user permissions. It is a heavily modified version of the work of dreamincode.net user pbl (original work: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/259777-a-simple-chat-program-with-clientserver-gui-optional/).

DISTRIBUTION

The following files are "client" files and should be distributed to any users (either alone or in a jar file) who you wish to be able connect to your server:

\<root folder>
	- Run Client.bat
	- Run Client (GUI).bat
\org\pavlinic\chat
	- ChatMessage.class
	- Client$ListenFromServer.class
	- Client.class
	- ClientGUI$1.class
	- ClientGUI$2.class
	- ClientGUI.class
\docs
	- README-CLIENT.txt

The following files are "server" files and are required to all be on the computer hosting the chat server:

\<root folder>
	- Run Server.bat
	- Run Server (GUI).bat
\org\pavlinic\chat
	- ChatMessage.class
	- Server$ClientThread.class
	- Server.class
	- ServerBot.class
	- ServerCommandHandler.class
	- ServerGUI$1.class
	- ServerGUI$2.class
	- ServerGUI$ServerRunning.class
	- ServerGUI.class
	- ServerPermissionsHandler.class

NOTES

* The GUI files could probably removed if running the client and/or server with a GUI is not desired.
* The .bat files are scripts used to start the client/server.
* If server commands are not desired, you MAY be able to exclude ServerCommandHandler.class, but this may result in undesired effects when a user attempts to use a command as the "command" is still trying to be passed to that file.
* The same applies to permissions, but some commands will try and reference ServerPermissionsHandler.class so that may also cause issues if removed.

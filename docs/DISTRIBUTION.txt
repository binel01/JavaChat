DISTRIBUTION

The following files are "client" files and should be distributed to any users (either alone or in a jar file)
who you wish to be able connect to your server:

<root folder>
	org\pavlinic\chat\
		- all files
	org\pavlinic\chat\client\
		- all files
	docs\
		- README-CLIENT.txt

The following files are "server" files and are required to all be on the computer hosting the chat server:

<root folder>
	org\pavlinic\chat\
		- all files
	org\pavlinic\chat\server\
		- all files
	docs\
		- README-SERVER.txt
		
NOTES

* The GUI files could probably removed if running the client and/or server with a GUI is not desired.
* If server commands are not desired, you MAY be able to exclude CommandHandler.class, but this may
  result in undesired effects when a user attempts to use a command as the "command" is still trying to be passed to that file.
* The same applies to permissions, but some commands will try and reference PermissionsHandler.class
  so that may also cause issues if removed.

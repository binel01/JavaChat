	- client will reject usernames longer than 16 characters
[6:20PM 7/28/2012]
	- the GUI client now allows users to set name before connecting to a server 
[4:48PM 7/28/2012]

SERVER
[10:16PM 4/29/2013]
	- refactored into org.pavlinic.chat.server for server-specific features
[8:58PM 8/4/2012]: v0.4-alpha
	- began implementing authentication system
		* the client has not yet been updated to support this update
		- accounts can be registered with /account register <password>
		- passwords are hashed and stored in data/logins-db/USERNAME.dat
		- users are only required to enter a password if the chosen name is already registered
			- registered accounts cannot be logged into unless given the correct password
		- passwords are hashed and then checked against the stored password hash
			- upon successful login: the user is connected as normal
			- upon unsuccessful login: the user is disconnected from the server and informed to try again
		- an account file is created for 'console' to prevent hacked clients from connecting under that name
	- feedback messages can now be sent to the client who issued a command via sendMessage()
	- reloading permissions now clears the arrays first 
[2:19PM 8/4/2012]: v0.3-alpha
	- changed the way user permissions are handled for commands
		- user rights are checked upon command entry, and then that variable is checked per command
		- command permissions are now numeric-based:
			* Console: 4
			* Administrator: 3
			* Operator: 2
			* Voiced: 1
			* Regular user: 0
			* Banned user: -1
	- server no longer adds an extra blank line after addPermission() and should now show correct numbers
	- entering a "/" with nothing after it will not be sent as a command, just as a message.
[9:14PM 8/2/2012]
	- added /version
[4:20PM 7/31/2012]
	- giving someone a temporary permission is no longer case sensitive
	- permissions that are saved to file are now saved with a \n to add a blank line afterwards
[11:04AM 7/31/2012]
	- permissions are now reloaded on giving a user permanent/auto permissions
	- fixed a typo that would cause users-voiced.txt to not be created if non-existent
	- added /reload to reload permissions
[6:13PM 7/30/2012]
	- added administrator rank (shares &-symbol with console in chat)
	- permissions are now read from file into an array on startup
		- console is always an administrator
		- files are created if they don't exist
	- added /mode
		- Operator modes: +m, -m, +o, -o, +v, -v, +b (saves permission to file), -b
		- Administrator modes: +O, +V (saves permission to file)
		- Console modes: +A (saves permission to file)
		- Permanently removing a user's auto-mode requires editing of the text file itself
	- console can no longer use /nick
	- TODO: Fix /kick and /mute, or something
[7:27PM 7/29/2012]
	- commands can now be sent from the server GUI (both /command and non-/command work)
		- server is known as 'Console' in commands and is in the op array by default
	- added /say for console-use only to broadcast a message as a normal user would
		- messages are displayed as "<&Console> Message."
	- added /userlist for console-suse only to display currently connected users
[8:25PM 7/28/2012]
	- /stop will now stop the server immediately instead of waiting for another client
	- began working on getting permission lists from file (broken/disabled at the moment)
[5:28PM 7/28/2012]
	- upon connection, usermode is displayed to all connected users (irc style)
		- Example: User1 connected. / <server> sets mode: +o User1
		- current modes: +o, +v, +b
[4:17PM 7/28/2012]
	- banned users cannot send commands
		- might need to allow /msg whenever that is added to question Operators
[4:04PM 7/28/2012]
	- names are now shown as IRC-style (e.g. <@username>)
		- TODO: clean code up maybe
	- finished adding voiced user rank
		- TODO: permissions(?)
	- began implementing a banlist in same style as op/voiced users
		- server will reject messages from users from this list
[8:20PM 7/27/2012]
	- began implementing a permissions manager
		- user permissions are managed via array lists in ServerPermissionsHandler
		- TODO: implement passwords/authentication
	- /mute and /kick now require operator status
	- added /stop command for operators
	- added user operators
		- users are checked against op array prior to sending messages/commands
[9:56PM 7/26/2012]
	- /kick and /mute now only display feedback if the given thread exists 
[11:45AM 7/26/2012]
	- cleaned up method used to find a specific thread
	- ClientThreads are now named upon receiving the username that they will handle
		- this.setName(username);
		- CommandHandler can now interact with user's based on name instead of id
	- Changed /kick to /mute
		- /kick would require "deafen" and "mute" deafen needs id and mute needs name
	- ServerBot: added !clienthreads to list threads and the username they represent

[5:16 PM 7/25/2012]
	- began work on "ServerBot" to as an alternative command handler
		- /commands would be "common" commands such as /kick and /me
		- !commands could be added by the server admin
			- might allow "custom" commands to be easily added this way from file
				- or might trash the idea and stick to only hard-coded /commands
		- added !about command
		- commands are still sent as messages, but ServerBot responds to everyone
			- might need to limit use of ServerBot to certain users
	- /kick now "mutes" a user, given by thread id

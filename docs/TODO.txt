TODO LIST
=========

CLIENT
* Add a nogui argument flag to ClientGUI so the jar can be run from the command prompt
  instead of having to launch the GUI-less version from a different jar/command.

SERVER
* Either add a boolean and if statements or make a stripped down
  version of initPermissions for reloading permissions and not having
  everything in the permission files re-added each time permissions need
  to be reloaded, as well as maybe "silent" reloading instead of outputting
  all the "created" and "loaded" statements (i.e. just 'permissions reloaded').
* Add a nogui argument flag to ServerGUI so the jar can be run from the command prompt
  instead of having to launch the GUI-less version from a different jar/command.
* Fix sendMessage so it doesn't cause an exception when the console uses a command that includes it

Since we can edit an individual's thread variables (e.g. username) using

	((ClientThread) Server.ClientThread.currentThread()).FOO = BAR;
	
we could easily make this a text-based RPG of some sort (i.e. MUD).
